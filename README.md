## Tasks

### `gulp lint`

Lint the code base for syntax and stylistic errors.

gulp lint
```

### Compilation

### `npm run build && npm run dist`

Generate the Newport Design System into the `.dist` directory and generate a zipped up version to be uploaded into Salesforce in the `dist` folder.

If you also want to deploy it to an org then run it with the following env variables:

```bash
SF_USERNAME=myusername@email.com SF_PASSWORD=mypassword npm run dist
```

## Troubleshooting

### npm and Node.js

The Vlocity Newport Design System uses `npm` to manage dependencies. Please [install Node.js](https://nodejs.org), and try running `npm install` again.

If Node.js is already installed, make sure youâ€™re running v8 or up.

### JavaScript and compilation issues

JavaScript dependencies sometimes get out of sync and inexplicable bugs start to happen. Follow these steps to give a fresh start to your development environment:

1. The installed `npm` version must be at least v3.10. You can update your npm with: `npm install npm -g` (`sudo` may be required).
2. Re-install dependencies: `rm -Rf node_modules && npm install`
3. `npm start`

If this did not work, try running `npm cache clean` and repeat the above steps.
